##concurrently##
we can use concurrently npm package tu get simular experiece as we get from
nodemon -e ts,json --exec \"npm run dev"\

concurrently \"npx tsc -w"\ \"nodemon dist/src/index.js"\

if we have script with name "start":"..."
and we create script "prestart":"..."  "prestart" will always run before "start" automatically 
"poststart" follows same logic it would always run after "start"
npm i --save-dev --save-exact prettier
